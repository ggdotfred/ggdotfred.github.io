              We want you to understand how and why BenchBug, Inc. (BenchBug,” “we” or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information about you when you access and use BenchBug's mobile apps and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us. This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services, including those that maintain a separate Privacy Notice that incorporates this Privacy Policy by reference. 
              <br><br>
              <b>Information You Provide to Us</b>
              <br><br>
              We collect the content and other information you provide when you use our Services. This includes information used to create your account (e.g., a username, password and an email address), account preferences, the content of private messages between you and other users or communities, and the content of information you post to the Services (e.g., text, photos, links).
              <br><br>
              <b>Information We Collect Automatically</b>
              <br><br>
              We may receive and process information about your location. For example, with your consent, we may collect information about the specific location of your mobile device (for example, by using GPS or Bluetooth). You can revoke this consent at any time by changing the preferences on your device, but doing so may affect your ability to use all of the features and functionality of our Services. We may also receive location information from you when you choose to share such information on our Services, including by associating your content with a location, or we may derive your approximate location from other information about you, including your IP address.
              <br><br>
              <b>How We Use Information About You</b>
              <br><br>
              We use information about you to:
              <ul>
              <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Services;</li>
              <li>Help protect the safety of Reddit and our users, which includes blocking suspected spammers, addressing abuse, and enforcing the Reddit user agreement;</li>
              <li>Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices and other support and administrative messages;</li>
              <li>Provide customer service;</li>
              <li>Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, and events, and provide other news and information we think will be of interest to you;</li>
              <li>Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services; 
              <li>Personalize the Services and provide advertisements, content and features that match user profiles or interests.
              </li>
              </ul>
              <br><br>
              <b>Ads and Analytics Partners</b>
              <br><br>
              We may partner with third-party advertisers, ad networks, and analytics providers to deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests and to better understand your use of the Services. These third parties may collect information sent by your computer, browser, or mobile device in response to a request for content, such as unique identifiers, your IP address, or other information about your computer or device. For example:
              <br><br>
              <b>Advertisers and Ad Networks</b>
              <br><br>
              Our ad partners and ad networks may use cookies and use related technologies to collect information when ads are delivered to you on our Services, but Reddit does not link to or provide them with your actual Reddit account details. This means that Reddit does not share your individual account browsing habits with advertisers. Reddit cannot see advertisers’ cookies and advertisers will not see Reddit cookies.
              <br><br>
              <b>Analytics Partners</b>
              <br><br>
              We use analytics partners (such as Google Analytics) to help analyze usage and traffic for our Services. As an example, we may use analytics partners to analyze and measure, in the aggregate, the number of unique visitors to our Services.
