              <h1> What is BenchBug? </h1>
              <p> BenchBug is a platform to discover all the trending topics on health and fitness. Users like you provide all of the content where you can "like" and "comment" on posts. 
              </p>

              <h1> I want to change my username. Do I have to start a new account? </h1>
              <p> Yes. Once a user account is created, the username cannot be edited. 
              </p>

              <h1> I made a mistake with my post, how can I edit it? </h1>
              <p> Categories and images cannot be edited but post descriptions can be edited. If you want, you can simply delete the post and create a new one again. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <h1> Am I allowed to advertise on BenchBug? </h1>
