<h1> 1. Open an individual brokerage account</h1>
<p>
  There are many great brokerages you can choose from. Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, and Charles Schwab are all great choices.
  <br>
  Robinhood is also a great choice because of the superb user experience and fantastic user interface most suitable for beginners.
  <br>
  However, because Robinhood is still a relatively small and growing company as of 2021, they do not have the resources for strong customer support and app stability.
  <br>
  If customer support and security is important to you, it is probably safer to go with the more established
  brokerages.
  <br>
  You must be over 18, and have a social security number in order for the brokerage to verify your identity.
</p>

<h1> 2. Research Companies </h1>
<p>
  Always understand <b>WHY</b> you are invested in the companies you picked.
  <br>
  For example, you should ask questions like:
  <br>
  Does this company have strong leadership?
  <br>
  Does this company have a record of consistent revenue growth?
  <br>
  Any news about this company recently?
  <br>
  A quick search for the company on our app will give you this information.
  <br>
  However, you can also take the long & tedious route and try to dig up information in the investor relations section of a company website or on a site like Yahoo Finance.
  <br>
  It's very easy to get overwhelemed with all the financial metrics and jargon available on the web.

<h1> 3. Understand your risk tolerance </h1>
<p>
  As with any investment, there is risk involved. Your level of risk may change according to your current financial situation, but it is important to understand that there no such thing as
  a 'guarantee' when it comes to investments.
  <br>
  Most portfolios (a collection of investments) are categorized from conservative to aggressive, with aggressive being to most risky portfolio.
  <br>
  Your risk tolerance determines your investment holdings and portfolio allocation.
  <br>
  If you have a more conservative risk tolerance, it may be wise for you to heavily diversify and
  hold stocks that are more stable. However, if you can afford more risk, it may be wise for you to take more aggressive positions.
  <br>
  After all, the higher the risk, the higher the reward.
</p>
<h1> 4. Have a plan, and stay patient. </h1>

<p>
  The U.S. stock market is open from 9am-4pm EST weekdays except for certain holidays.
  <br>
  It is during this time that you are able to buy or sell stocks.
  <br>
  There's a saying that says "money is made for time in the market, not time out the market." If you treat the markets like a casino, the house will eventually win.
  <br>
  Good money is made over the long term. If you've done your research well and are investing in quality companies, you <b>do NOT</b> want to be concerned with short-term price movements.
