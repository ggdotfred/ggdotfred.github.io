<h1> 1. Open a brokerage account </h1>
<p>
  There are many great brokerages you can choose from. I will say from my own personal experience that Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, and Charles Schwab are all great choices.
  You can also use Robinhood for a better overall app experience but just be aware that Robinhood had some security issues ( that hopefully has been patched up now )
  and has weak customer support team where you can only email them and thus can expect a response anywhere from a day later to a week later. This probably won't change anytime soon.
  If customer support is important to you, it is probably safer to go with the more established
  brokerages that I mentioned earlier.

  <br>
  I suggest everyone, especially those currently employed, to open an individual brokerage account. It takes less than 5 minutes to sign up for one; answer a few questions, wait for approval,
  and you are on your way to making money!

<h1> 2. Find a few companies you are interested in. Do your research, understand your market. </h1>

<h1> 3. Determine your risk tolerance </h1>
<p>
  As with any investment, there is risk involved. Your level of risk may differ according to your current financial situation, but it is important to understand that there no such thing as
  a 'guarantee' when it comes to investments.
  <br>
  Most portfolios are categorized as aggressive to conservative, with aggressive being to most risky portfolio.
  <br>
  Your risk tolerance affects your holdings and portfolio allocation. If you have a more conservative risk tolerance, it may be wise for you to heavily diversify and
  hold mainly large cap stocks. However, if you can afford more risk, it may be wise for you to take more aggressive positions.
  <br>
  After all, the higher the risk, the higher the reward.
